## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Note about the Scraper

This bot uses a basic web scraper built with [Playwright](https://playwright.dev/). It works best with websites that do not implement aggressive anti-scraping techniques. It has been tested on sites like **mattilbud.no**.

Limitations include:

- Aggressive bot detection  
- Complex CAPTCHAs  
- JavaScript-heavy content loading  
- Strict `robots.txt` rules  

If a store URL doesn't work, it may be due to such protections.

## üîí Legal and Ethical Considerations

Using this bot responsibly is essential. This tool is intended for **educational and personal use only**.

**Before scraping any website:**

- **Check `robots.txt`**: Respect the site's access rules.  
- **Review Terms of Service**: Some sites prohibit scraping entirely.  
- **Rate Limit Requests**: Avoid overloading servers. This bot posts once weekly by default.  
- **Limit Data Use**: Use scraped content only to display flyers inside Discord.  
- **Contact Site Owners**: For regular or large-scale scraping, consider asking permission.  
- **Understand Fair Use**: Know how copyright and content usage laws apply in your region.  

> **Disclaimer**: The developers of this bot are not liable for misuse or legal issues. Use responsibly and at your own risk.
